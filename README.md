The story here comes from my mother's archives. She had a great-aunt, Geneviève Hennet de Goutel, who joined the French Red Cross in 1913 to become a chief nurse. She signed up for the Berthelot Mission in October 1916, whose purpose was to organize the Romanian troops, supplies and medical care as the German army was moving South.

Geneviève was part of the first of the four teams. The journey took two weeks, as the Red Cross had to go through Scandinavia and Russia to avoid the front. They discovered Bucarest's brand new hospital on October 22th, which was build with the help of the allied Western countries. But the French team could only stay there for a few weeks. In December, the German marching on Bucarest caused the French Foreign Ministry to order the nurses to flee the capital, and start over near Iasi (a small town 20 km away from the Russian border), in a pretty ran-down manor hidden in the forest, called "Geierul".

So the experience went straight from proud charity to intense chaos, since supplies and co-workers could not easily be brought to Geierul in the absence of a proper road. The Romanian and Russian new troops were flocking everywhere around ; and the winter began. The poor living conditions and general promiscuity resulted in an immediate epidemic raise of the typhus fever. By February, the next French Red Cross teams were coming to care for their colleagues as well as wounded soldiers.

Geneviève wrote letters and a journal, that were even published in the press (for propaganda purpose) at some point. She was fond of her work and befriended everyone on her journey - including the Queen Maria of Romania - and was greatly admired. She wrote her journal until February 1917, when she fell ill herself. She died in March, aged (almost) 32. Her papers were then carefully copied multiple times by her younger sister, Marguerite, to be used for biographies and family memory.
